# Figures Documentation

This directory contains the scripts to generate the figures presented in the main paper.
Use a virtual environment with the required dependencies installed from the `requirements.txt` file to run the scripts.

The processed data used to create the figures can be found in the `data` directory. Each figure script reads from these processed data files to generate the corresponding plots.
